  { question: "What makes your retreats different from others?", answer: "Our retreats are designed with intention. Every detail — from the setting to the website where you first discover us — reflects calm, trust, and authenticity. We create spaces where body, mind, and spirit align." },
  { question: "How do I book a retreat?", answer: "Booking is simple and secure through our website. Just select your retreat, choose your dates, and reserve your spot in a few clicks." },
  { question: "Do I need previous experience in yoga or wellness practices?", answer: "Not at all. Our retreats are created for everyone — from beginners to advanced practitioners. You’ll always be guided with care and respect for your own pace." },
  { question: "What is included in the retreat price?", answer: "Each retreat includes accommodation, meals, daily practices, and guided sessions. Some retreats also offer workshops, excursions, or wellness treatments — details are always listed on the retreat page." },
  { question: "Can I attend alone?", answer: "Yes, many of our guests come solo. Retreats are a wonderful way to connect with like-minded people while also having space for personal reflection." },
  { question: "Are the retreats suitable for couples or groups?", answer: "Absolutely. Whether you’re joining with a partner, friend, or group, our retreats are designed to nurture both individual and shared experiences." },
  { question: "How do I know which retreat is right for me?", answer: "Each retreat has its own focus — from yoga and meditation to holistic health or coaching. On our website, you’ll find detailed descriptions to help you choose the one that best aligns with your current journey." },
  { question: "What should I bring with me?", answer: "Comfortable clothing for practice, personal items, and an open mind. A full packing list will be sent to you once your booking is confirmed." },
  { question: "What happens if I need to cancel my reservation?", answer: "We understand that plans can change. Each retreat has its own cancellation policy, clearly explained during booking, so you know exactly what to expect." },
  { question: "How do I stay connected after the retreat?", answer: "Our retreats don’t end when you leave. We provide resources, practices, and ways to stay in touch with the community — so your journey continues long after." },
